[Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1)

Day 1 took some time to get used to the "stack" (Go syntax, common libraries, idioms, etc.). Ended up taking some time debugging on part b due to trying to define and use a `sortedInts` struct, but eventually decided to pre-process and sort the ints before hand. Had some off-by-one errors but not too long to debug.
