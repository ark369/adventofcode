[Day 13](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/13)

Toughest one so far this year. Part B required re-learning the [Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://brilliant.org/wiki/chinese-remainder-theorem/), which in turn required re-learning how to solve congruences. Ended up using brute force to solve them, which is fast for the given input, but the correct solution is the [Extended Eulcidean Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm).

But genuinely fun!
