Personal solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

I mostly use [The Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/), with my personal input pasted into the `ReadInput()` function. I usually use `ReadFakeInput()` to validate code with the example given. I then just use the Github UI to create files and paste my solution (with the raw inputs deleted).
